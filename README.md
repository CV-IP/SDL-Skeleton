## SDL-Skeleton

   **This is a toolbox for object skeleton detection, which can also be used for other pixel-wise binary classification tasks, such as edge detection, building extraction and road extraction.**

## Datasets
**Skeleton Detection""
  Five commonly used skeleton datasets are used, including [sklarge](https://kaizhao.net/sk-large)、[sk506](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Shen_Object_Skeleton_Extraction_CVPR_2016_paper.html)、[sympascal](https://github.com/KevinKecc/SRN)、[symmax](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-33786-4_4) and [whsymmax](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.patcog.2015.10.015). You also can download all these datasets at [here](). The preliminary data augmentation code can be downloaded at [sklarge](https://kaizhao.net/sk-large), including resizing images to 3 scales (0.8x, 1.0x, and 1.2x), rotating for 4 directions (0◦, 90◦, 180◦,and 270◦), flipping in 2 orientations. After that, you can use resolution normalization technology (dataRN.py), which helps for skeleton detection because of their different image size.
